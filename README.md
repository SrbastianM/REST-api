# Foody
I know, the name of the repository is not the same as the name of the API, but in the progress of creation I came up with some ideas and thought “This name is going to be good”.
So Foody was just born.

### Instalation
Run the make file with the following command to install all the package, run the test's and check the files:
```CMD
make audit
```
### How to Run it:
Type in youre terminal before clone the repository, at this moment I asume you have git in youre machine so:
```CMD
make run
```
# Foody API 
Let's begin talking about the end point's of the API. Now it have 10 enpoints which are:

## This Enpoinst are the create, delete, update, and read of table "foods" |The endpoint named "healthcheck" is an exception|

Well, about the use of the API I take into account that you are thinking “well, how do I use it?” so in this part I describe how to make the request to use it

# AUTH

#### Register and user into the API
Well to describe the process behind of this request, when the user is register into the API is launching a goroutine wich send a SMTP using parameter email in the JSON
```CMD
    BODY='{"name": "Tenki Me", "email": "tenkivale@example.com", "password": "pa55word"}'
    curl -i -d "$BODY" localhost:4000/v1/users
```
#### Activate user
To activate a user it is important to complete the above steps before continuing. When a user registers in the database, a token is assigned to him/her that will be sent to him/her by mail once the registration process is finished. I forgot to mention that when a user 
is registered and activated, the API gives him/her a “role” that by default is read -> I will go deeper into this topic below
```CMD
  curl -X PUT -d '{"token": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"}' localhost:4000/v1/users/activated
```
#### Authenticate user
After the previous steps ther user is register and activated in to the API, so for now use the credentials will passed before in the registration process to authenticate the user.
```CMD
  BODY='{"email": "tenkivale@example.com", "password": "pa55word"}'
  curl -d "$BODY" localhost:4000/v1/tokens/authentication
```
-> API response:
```JSON
  {
  	"authentication_token": {
  		"token": "WRLR2UTQ6X35XVK6PVR3KG2ABA", -> This is an example of the token
  		"expiry": "2025-02-14T13:36:57.732112981-05:00" -> The date when the token expire
  	}
  }
```
---
## At this moment you can use the rest of the endpoints if youre following the previous steps
Do you remember now the token generated in the authentication step? It is the most important thing because without it you cannot use the following endpoints
#### CreateFood:
This enpoint has a specially thing beacuse only user with the permission "read/write" can create new records into the foods table
```CMD
  BODY='{"title":"Soup", "types":["onion", "potatoo", "pepper"]}'
  curl -i -d "$BODY" -H "Authorization: Bearer WRLR2UTQ6X35XVK6PVR3KG2ABA" localhost:4000/v1/foods
```
If you dont have the permissions to create records in to the table, the API returns the error below:
```JSON
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application-json
Vary: Authorization
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:57:29 GMT
Content-Length: 97

{
	"error": "your user account doesn't have the necessary permissions to access this resource"
}
```
instead return this:
```JSON
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application-json
Location: /v/foods/5
Vary: Authorization
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2025 19:07:53 GMT
Content-Length: 199

{
	"food": {
		"ID": 5,
		"CreateAt": "2025-02-13T19:07:54Z",
		"Title": "Soup",
		"Types": [
			"onion",
			"potatoo",
			"pepper"
		],
		"Version": 1
	}
}
{Title:Soup Types:[onion potatoo pepper]}
```
#### updateFood
Likewise I told before only user with the permissions of write and read can update records.
```CMD
  BODY='{"title":"Soup Update", "types":["onion", "update", "pepper"]}'
  curl -X PATCH -d "$BODY" -H "Authorization: Bearer ITVDVHAJEJCXTKKDRDUZ3F5IXU" localhost:4000/v1/foods/5
```
if everthing is good, the API returns this:
```JSON
{
	"food": {
		"ID": 5,
		"CreateAt": "2025-02-13T19:07:54Z",
		"Title": "Soup Update", -> The update is present
		"Types": [
			"onion",
			"update", -> And here
			"pepper"
		],
		"Version": 2 -> The version number is higher because the registration has differences
	}
}
```
#### showFood
This endpoint can access by all the users (obviosly register and actived) just because only need the "read" permission to use it.
```CMD
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ITVDVHAJEJCXTKKDRDUZ3F5IXU" localhost:4000/v1/foods/5
```
API returns:
```JSON
{
	"food": {
		"ID": 5,
		"CreateAt": "2025-02-13T19:07:54Z",
		"Title": "Soup Update",
		"Types": [
			"onion",
			"update",
			"pepper"
		],
		"Version": 2
	}
}
```
#### listFood
This endpoint like I told in the previous step, is acceded by all the user register and activated in the API.
```CMD
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ITVDVHAJEJCXTKKDRDUZ3F5IXU" localhost:4000/v1/foods
```
The API returns:
```JSON
{
	"foods": [
		{
			"ID": 3,
			"CreateAt": "2025-02-05T15:05:17Z",
			"Title": "Pizza",
			"Types": [
				"pepperoni",
				"fastfood",
				"chesee"
			],
			"Version": 1
		},
		{
			"ID": 4,
			"CreateAt": "2025-02-05T15:05:52Z",
			"Title": "Soup Test",
			"Types": [
				"onion",
				"potatoo",
				"pepper"
			],
			"Version": 1
		},
		{
			"ID": 5,
			"CreateAt": "2025-02-13T19:07:54Z",
			"Title": "Soup Update",
			"Types": [
				"onion",
				"update",
				"pepper"
			],
			"Version": 2
		}
	],
	"metada": {
		"CurrentPage": 1,
		"PageSize": 20,
		"FirstPage": 1,
		"LastPage": 1,
		"TotalRecords": 3
	}
}
```

For now feel safe to clone this repository and run in youre local machine, is not deployed now but in a few days I guess it happens
